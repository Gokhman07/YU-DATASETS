1,Can you explain this slide?,"This slide introduces Chapter 1, focusing on ""Statistical models and social science."" It introduces the connection between statistical models and social science. It highlights the complexity of social data, the need for aggregate predictability, and the application of AI/ML in various domains like online moderation, advertising, fraud detection, and financial markets.",1,1,in this course we are going to look at certain aspects of how to make sense of human data because data is not always straight so data is not always straight sometimes data is cute and then you know that to make sense of the particular data you know that if you have a question can anybody give an example like an essay data analysis in the real world? what sort of data analysis is big companies? what sort of analysis is it is in the idea? what you face in the real world? just just be some time in terms of the income of citizens so who will be interested in it? the government will be brought here so the U.J. is telling them income of citizens so based on that government will bring its policies and then they will take use and in this particular income line there are many people they need some support so that is good anyone answer from online? so any can anybody online experience the data analysis in real life? yes I think it is everyone had experience from data science is a previous semester because we had that acquisition of management cars and for myself I had some real work experience in text analysis okay you have experience in what field? a natural language process oh a natural language so can you just one or two lines? can you explain to the class what exactly what sort of data you analyzed and then what purpose you analyzed? in my question yeah you need not tell the details but at a high level you can just explain you said natural language was singed right? what sort of data you were collecting? I for natural language processing actually in this task I worked with with structure of web applications and I built some board metrics that convert text to array of list of numbers and develop neural networks for the analysis okay you are converting text to some arrays and then develop neural networks so what is the purpose of the neural network? like yes I appreciate you are going into the little bit detail of that okay you are using the text ultimately for what purpose? your neural network is doing some classification? yes it was classification was boundary specifications it is what I can talk about that we have for example two structure of elements of web application of value applications and neural networks should define its similar or not? okay it was actually a task of boundary classification okay you are doing the binary classification thank you so much so the result is giving this input so it was dealing data in the form of text usually it is a data in the form of income you know so income of residents of New York state so accordingly the state government can plan when the reactivity is open and some needs you know according so there is some text classification so probably one of the things of text classification is their 8th speech so especially these social media accounts you know so they they try to analyze what sort of you know posts you are doing and then immediately whether it falls into the category of killed or it's okay and then you know there is some objectionable thing so accordingly they try to censor it so you know so ultimately the thing is so they are trying to analyze the data every moment another thing like we can see is most of you might have experienced when you are doing some window shopping or online shopping you look for a particular product and then you don't you are not going to take it and you may take it later or you may just add it in the cart and leave it but at the same time you see that after three or four days when you are just browsing you get ads which are relevant to that particular product did you did you experience anything like that anytime so sometimes the ads are you know engineered as per our interest so this is some some sort of social engineering you are doing so this is based on the data they are collecting from our own browsing activities so the idea is there's a huge amount of data and then analyzing the data helps to enlarge each individual's business so that is the main purpose of this data and then we are doing lot of you know modeling of this particular data now the thing is the data whatever we have it's not always smooth and straightforward as it looks so we need to organize it properly for example if you are looking the browsing activity in a particular geographical location of the world so their needs will be different like suppose in all countries now people may be always looking for sweaters but when you are looking in and of dessert climate kind of like tropical countries which are close to equator so they will not be looking like various types of you know jerking and then all those things so when you are trying to understand the patterns buying patterns so you should collect the data accordingly now so the data you should not look for the data in a wrong place so what we are trying to say is data sometimes is skew so that's why whenever we are trying to do some sort of data analysis we should try to pick up our analysis techniques in a right way so I am just setting the precedent for the course so whatever we are discussing so they will be handling these indicate problems in data analysis so with this linear regression both simple and multiple and then these methods logistic regression and then non parameter regression and so on so the idea is these particular data modifications they will help further in machine learning this classifications just like Russell said so he is using some sort of text analysis and then all those things so that will go as an input to neural networks the neural networks are doing some sort of binary classification so similarly you know what is the pre processing data processing needed so that it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John this I have already uploaded a PDF and the Canvas course page is referred to that so that is the book so no need to run with the online videos so that is all not so you can just and then yeah so these are like broadly the distribution of grading every week you will be given an assignment to work on there will be deadlines so that will become according the particular person after the whole period so there will be one final exam that will be in around the first week of May or maybe end of April and yeah so that can be online or it will be hit person that can be at the side and there will be two projects so midterm and midterm project so there will be a presentation it's broadly this the details of midterm and midterm project I will upload after couple of weeks so this is it and then yeah the dates are there yeah you just get a idea of what we are broadly what we will broadly copy in this particular course so any questions still now before we go to the module one okay so let us go to today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be discussing something's left here so you just started with a very nice example that by the way the status gets up needed so you said very nice example that people collect income of the population so that they can plan the values that are activities accordingly how do you think you should copy it or any other similar example would you like to think or I wish by people collect standard those statistics like any other example anybody online also with respect to the social science think of you know demographics gender there are so many other things Professor can I go yeah yeah please so statistics we can use statistics for climate analysis so for gathering gathering the wind wind wind blow percentage and we can predict I mean there is a cyclone or something okay okay let's do this climate modeling so that's good yeah specifically that we say especially related to the society so we can think of something like this like people sometimes say that okay if you want to earn this particular income you know so what is the degree needed so how much education you have they try to map the income okay and sometimes people see that governments they are more what are the concerns for the government yes I wish one is to definitely provide them for activities to be any other any other thing which is which concerns the law income income anything else government is worried about the law enforcement yeah and then so crime rate of the control of the crime rate so government collects this particular data you know like a big cities you know like a very high levels of crime rate and then they try to correlate that particular dependent variable I mean like the crime rate on some observable maybe very okay why this is happening maybe because of lack of resources development or maybe because of poor education so like that so statistics are you know invent even in protocols society and then so there are obviously there are like various factors especially in human and in the accident so as the sites address so there are often multiple you know variables that are influencing the outcome of a particular way they are dependent variable and then there are observable variables so based on the observations we got from various variables a particular factor is influenced so we will be coming to that so often these things are quite complex it's not that that's straightforward correlation is there so how related to this and then we we discussed some of these things like online community moderation like a person is doing the AIDS page or some vulgar things or somebody is trying to influence the decisions like a forward what is the name like they try to push some particular agendas so it's broadly socially generic but especially politicians and government especially before the elections so these friends are quite calm so online community they try to pedal some particular narratives so that's what so I'm not taking sides of any politics but I'm just telling these things to happen okay and then the financial markets how to predict the share price and then blah blah so there is something called a supervised learning and a supervised learning and there is a reinforcement like,summarization
2,What is the chapter's title?,The chapter's title is 'Statistical models and social science'.,1,1,in this course we are going to look at certain aspects of how to make sense of human data because data is not always straight so data is not always straight sometimes data is cute and then you know that to make sense of the particular data you know that if you have a question can anybody give an example like an essay data analysis in the real world? what sort of data analysis is big companies? what sort of analysis is it is in the idea? what you face in the real world? just just be some time in terms of the income of citizens so who will be interested in it? the government will be brought here so the U.J. is telling them income of citizens so based on that government will bring its policies and then they will take use and in this particular income line there are many people they need some support so that is good anyone answer from online? so any can anybody online experience the data analysis in real life? yes I think it is everyone had experience from data science is a previous semester because we had that acquisition of management cars and for myself I had some real work experience in text analysis okay you have experience in what field? a natural language process oh a natural language so can you just one or two lines? can you explain to the class what exactly what sort of data you analyzed and then what purpose you analyzed? in my question yeah you need not tell the details but at a high level you can just explain you said natural language was singed right? what sort of data you were collecting? I for natural language processing actually in this task I worked with with structure of web applications and I built some board metrics that convert text to array of list of numbers and develop neural

today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be

3,What is the key feature of social science mentioned here?,"The key features include:
 1. Too complex to understand every detail (unlike physics, which follows exact rules).
 2. Aggregate predictability (trends can be analyzed at a broader level despite individual unpredictability).",1,1,in this course we are going to look at certain aspects of how to make sense of human data because data is not always straight so data is not always straight sometimes data is cute and then you know that to make sense of the particular data you know that if you have a question can anybody give an example like an essay data analysis in the real world? what sort of data analysis is big companies? what sort of analysis is it is in the idea? what you face in the real world? just just be some time in terms of the income of citizens so who will be interested in it? the government will be brought here so the U.J. is telling them income of citizens so based on that government will bring its policies and then they will take use and in this particular income line there are many people they need some support so that is good anyone answer from online? so any can anybody online experience the data analysis in real life? yes I think it is everyone had experience from data science is a previous semester because we had that acquisition of management cars and for myself I had some real work experience in text analysis okay you have experience in what field? a natural language process oh a natural language so can you just one or two lines? can you explain to the class what exactly what sort of data you analyzed and then what purpose you analyzed? in my question yeah you need not tell the details but at a high level you can just explain you said natural language was singed right? what sort of data you were collecting?

4,What are some AI/ML applications listed on this slide?,"AI/ML is used in:
 1.Online community moderation (detecting hate speech and misinformation).
 2. Personalization (tailoring recommendations based on user behavior).
 3. Advertising (targeted marketing based on browsing history).
 4. Trading financial markets (predicting stock price trends).
 5. Fraud detection (identifying suspicious financial transactions).
 6. Individualized medicine (predicting disease risks for specific patients).",1,1,in this course we are going to look at certain aspects of how to make sense of human data because data is not always straight so data is not always straight sometimes data is cute and then you know that to make sense of the particular data you know that if you have a question can anybody give an example like an essay data analysis in the real world? what sort of data analysis is big companies? what sort of analysis is it is in the idea? what you face in the real world? just just be some time in terms of the income of citizens so who will be interested in it? the government will be brought here so the U.J. is telling them income of citizens so based on that government will bring its policies and then they will take use and in this particular income line there are many people they need some support so that is good anyone answer from online? so any can anybody online experience the data analysis in real life? yes I think it is everyone had experience from data science is a previous semester because we had that acquisition of management cars and for myself I had some real work experience in text analysis okay you have experience in what field? a natural language process oh a natural language so can you just one or two lines? can you explain to the class what exactly what sort of data you analyzed and then what purpose you analyzed? in my question yeah you need not tell the details but at a high level you can just explain you said natural language was singed right? what sort of data you were collecting? I for natural language processing actually in this task I worked with with structure of web applications and I built some board metrics that convert text to array of list of numbers and develop neural networks for the analysis okay you are converting text to some arrays and then develop neural networks so what is the purpose of the neural network? like yes I appreciate you are going into the little bit detail of that okay you are using the text ultimately for what purpose? your neural network is doing some classification? yes it was classification was boundary specifications it is what I can talk about that we have for example two structure of elements of web application of value applications and neural networks should define its similar or not? okay it was actually a task of boundary classification okay you are doing the binary classification thank you so much so the result is giving this input so it was dealing data in the form of text usually it is a data in the form of income you know so income of residents of New York state so accordingly the state government can plan when the reactivity is open and some needs you know according so there is some text classification so probably one of the things of text classification is their 8th speech so especially these social media accounts you know so they they try to analyze what sort of you know posts you are doing and then immediately whether it falls into the category of killed or it's okay and then you know there is some objectionable thing so accordingly they try to censor it so you know so ultimately the thing is so they are trying to analyze the data every moment another thing like we can see is most of you might have experienced when you are doing some window shopping or online shopping you look for a particular product and then you don't you are not going to take it and you may take it later or you may just add it in the cart and leave it but at the same time you see that after three or four days when you are just browsing you get ads which are relevant to that particular product did you did you experience anything like that anytime so sometimes the ads are you know engineered as per our interest so this is some some sort of social engineering you are doing so this is based on the data they are collecting from our own browsing activities so the idea is there's a huge amount of data and then analyzing the data helps to enlarge each individual's business so that is the main purpose of this data and then we are doing lot of you know modeling of this particular data now the thing is the data whatever we have it's not always smooth and straightforward as it looks so we need to organize it properly for example if you are looking the browsing activity in a particular geographical location of the world so their needs will be different like suppose in all countries now people may be always looking for sweaters but when you are looking in and of dessert climate kind of like tropical countries which are close to equator so they will not be looking like various types of you know jerking and then all those things so when you are trying to understand the patterns buying patterns so you should collect the data accordingly now so the data you should not look for the data in a wrong place so what we are trying to say is data sometimes is skew so that's why whenever we are trying to do some sort of data analysis we should try to pick up our analysis techniques in a right way so I am just setting the precedent for the course so whatever we are discussing so they will be handling these indicate problems in data analysis so with this linear regression both simple and multiple and then these methods logistic regression and then non parameter regression and so on so the idea is these particular data modifications they will help further in machine learning this classifications just like Russell said so he is using some sort of text analysis and then all those things so that will go as an input to neural networks the neural networks are doing some sort of binary classification so similarly you know what is the pre processing data processing needed so that it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John this I have already uploaded a PDF and the Canvas course page is referred to that so that is the book so no need to run with the online videos so that is all not so you can just and then yeah so these are like broadly the distribution of grading every week you will be given an assignment to work on there will be deadlines so that will become according the particular person after the whole period so there will be one final exam that will be in around the first week of May or maybe end of April and yeah so that can be online or it will be hit person that can be at the side and there will be two projects so midterm and midterm project so there will be a presentation it's broadly this the details of midterm and midterm project I will upload after couple of weeks so this is it and then yeah the dates are there yeah you just get a idea of what we are broadly what we will broadly copy in this particular course so any questions still now before we go to the module one okay so let us go to today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be discussing something's left here so you just started with a very nice example that by the way the status gets up needed so you said very nice example that people collect income of the population so that they can plan the values that are activities accordingly how do you think you should copy it or any other similar example would you like to think or I wish by people collect standard those statistics like any other example anybody online also with respect to the social science think of you know demographics gender there are so many other things Professor can I go yeah yeah please so statistics we can use statistics for climate analysis so for gathering gathering the wind wind wind blow percentage and we can predict I mean there is a cyclone or something okay okay let's do this climate modeling so that's good yeah specifically that we say especially related to the society so we can think of something like this like people sometimes say that okay if you want to earn this particular income you know so what is the degree needed so how much education you have they try to map the income okay and sometimes people see that governments they are more what are the concerns for the government yes I wish one is to definitely provide them for activities to be any other any other thing which is which concerns the law income income anything else government is worried about the law enforcement yeah and then so crime rate of the control of the crime rate so government collects this particular data you know like a big cities you know like a very high levels of crime rate and then they try to correlate that particular dependent variable I mean like the crime rate on some observable maybe very okay why this is happening maybe because of lack of resources development or maybe because of poor education so like that so statistics are you know invent even in protocols society and then so there are obviously there are like various factors especially in human and in the accident so as the sites address so there are often multiple you know variables that are influencing the outcome of a particular way they are dependent variable and then there are observable variables so based on the observations we got from various variables a particular factor is influenced so we will be coming to that so often these things are quite complex it's not that that's straightforward correlation is there so how related to this and then we we discussed some of these things like online community moderation like a person is doing the AIDS page or some vulgar things or somebody is trying to influence the decisions like a forward what is the name like they try to push some particular agendas so it's broadly socially generic but especially politicians and government especially before the elections so these friends are quite calm so online community they try to pedal some particular narratives so that's what so I'm not taking sides of any politics but I'm just telling these things to happen okay and then the financial markets how to predict the share price and then blah blah so there is something called a supervised learning and a supervised learning and there is a reinforcement like,information_extraction
5,How is social science contrasted with Newtonian physics?,"Social science is described as too complex to understand every detail, unlike the predictability and structured understanding of Newtonian physics.",1,1,in this course we are going to look at certain aspects of how to make sense of human data because data is not always straight so data is not always straight sometimes data is cute and then you know that to make sense of the particular data you know that if you have a question can anybody give an example like an essay data analysis in the real world? what sort of data analysis is big companies? what sort of analysis is it is in the idea? what you face in the real world? just just be some time in terms of the income of citizens so who will be interested in it? the government will be brought here so the U.J. is telling them income of citizens so based on that government will bring its policies and then they will take use and in this particular income line there are many people they need some support so that is good anyone answer from online? so any can anybody online experience the data analysis in real life? yes I think it is everyone had experience from data science is a previous semester because we had that acquisition of management cars and for myself I had some real work experience in text analysis okay you have experience in what field? a natural language process oh a natural language so can you just one or two lines? can you explain to the class what exactly what sort of data you analyzed and then what purpose you analyzed? in my question yeah you need not tell the details but at a high level you can just explain you said natural language was singed right? what sort of data you were collecting? I for natural language processing actually in this task I worked with with structure of web applications and I built some board metrics that convert text to array of list of numbers and develop neural networks for the analysis okay you are converting text to some arrays and then develop neural networks so what is the purpose of the neural network? like yes I appreciate you are going into the little bit detail of that okay you are using the text ultimately for what purpose? your neural network is doing some classification? yes it was classification was boundary specifications it is what I can talk about that we have for example two structure of elements of web application of value applications and neural networks should define its similar or not? okay it was actually a task of boundary classification okay you are doing the binary classification thank you so much so the result is giving this input so it was dealing data in the form of text usually it is a data in the form of income you know so income of residents of New York state so accordingly the state government can plan when the reactivity is open and some needs you know according so there is some text classification so probably one of the things of text classification is their 8th speech so especially these social media accounts you know so they they try to analyze what sort of you know posts you are doing and then immediately whether it falls into the category of killed or it's okay and then you know there is some objectionable thing so accordingly they try to censor it so you know so ultimately the thing is so they are trying to analyze the data every moment another thing like we can see is most of you might have experienced when you are doing some window shopping or online shopping you look for a particular product and then you don't you are not going to take it and you may take it later or you may just add it in the cart and leave it but at the same time you see that after three or four days when you are just browsing you get ads which are relevant to that particular product did you did you experience anything like that anytime so sometimes the ads are you know engineered as per our interest so this is some some sort of social engineering you are doing so this is based on the data they are collecting from our own browsing activities so the idea is there's a huge amount of data and then analyzing the data helps to enlarge each individual's business so that is the main purpose of this data and then we are doing lot of you know modeling of this particular data now the thing is the data whatever we have it's not always smooth and straightforward as it looks so we need to organize it properly for example if you are looking the browsing activity in a particular geographical location of the world so their needs will be different like suppose in all countries now people may be always looking for sweaters but when you are looking in and of dessert climate kind of like tropical countries which are close to equator so they will not be looking like various types of you know jerking and then all those things so when you are trying to understand the patterns buying patterns so you should collect the data accordingly now so the data you should not look for the data in a wrong place so what we are trying to say is data sometimes is skew so that's why whenever we are trying to do some sort of data analysis we should try to pick up our analysis techniques in a right way so I am just setting the precedent for the course so whatever we are discussing so they will be handling these indicate problems in data analysis so with this linear regression both simple and multiple and then these methods logistic regression and then non parameter regression and so on so the idea is these particular data modifications they will help further in machine learning this classifications just like Russell said so he is using some sort of text analysis and then all those things so that will go as an input to neural networks the neural networks are doing some sort of binary classification so similarly you know what is the pre processing data processing needed so that it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John this I have already uploaded a PDF and the Canvas course page is referred to that so that is the book so no need to run with the online videos so that is all not so you can just and then yeah so these are like broadly the distribution of grading every week you will be given an assignment to work on there will be deadlines so that will become according the particular person after the whole period so there will be one final exam that will be in around the first week of May or maybe end of April and yeah so that can be online or it will be hit person that can be at the side and there will be two projects so midterm and midterm project so there will be a presentation it's broadly this the details of midterm and midterm project I will upload after couple of weeks so this is it and then yeah the dates are there yeah you just get a idea of what we are broadly what we will broadly copy in this particular course so any questions still now before we go to the module one okay so let us go to today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be discussing something's left here so you just started with a very nice example that by the way the status gets up needed so you said very nice example that people collect income of the population so that they can plan the values that are activities accordingly how do you think you should copy it or any other similar example would you like to think or I wish by people collect standard those

things to happen okay and then the financial markets how to predict the share price and then blah blah so there is something called a supervised learning and a supervised learning and there is a

things so that will go as an input to neural networks the neural networks are doing some sort of binary classification so similarly you know what is the pre processing data processing needed so that it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John this I have already uploaded a PDF and the Canvas course page is referred to that so that is the book so no need to run with the online videos so that is all not so you can just and then yeah so these are like broadly the distribution of grading every week you will be given an assignment to work on there will be deadlines so that will become according the particular person after the whole period so there will be one final exam that will be in around the first week of May or maybe end of April and yeah so that can be online or it will be hit person that can be at the side and there will be two projects so midterm and midterm project so there will be a presentation it's broadly this the details of midterm and midterm project I will upload after couple of weeks so this is it and then yeah the dates are there yeah you just get a idea of what we are broadly what we will broadly copy in this particular course so any questions still now before we go to the module one okay so let us go to today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be discussing something's left here so you just started with a very nice example that by the way the status gets up needed so you said very nice example that people collect income of the population so that they can plan the values that are activities accordingly how do you think you should copy it or any other similar example would you like to think or I wish by people collect standard those statistics like any other example anybody online also with respect to the social science think of you know demographics gender there are so many other things Professor can I go yeah yeah please so statistics we can use statistics for climate analysis so for gathering gathering the wind wind wind blow percentage and we can predict I mean there is a cyclone or something okay okay let's do this climate modeling so that's good yeah specifically that we say especially related to the society so we can think of something like this like people sometimes say that okay if you want to earn this particular income you know so what is the degree needed so how much education you have they try to map the income okay and sometimes people see that governments they are more what are the concerns for the government yes I wish one is to definitely provide them for activities to be any other any other thing which is which concerns the law income income anything else government is worried about the law enforcement yeah and then so crime rate of the control of the crime rate so government collects this particular data you know like a big cities you know like a very high levels of crime rate and then they try to correlate that particular dependent variable I mean like the crime rate on some observable maybe very okay why this is happening maybe because of lack of resources development or maybe because of poor education so like that so statistics are you know invent even in protocols society and then so there are obviously there are like various factors especially in human and in the accident so as the sites address so there are often multiple you know variables that are influencing the outcome of a particular way they are dependent variable and then there are observable variables so based on the observations we got from various variables a particular factor is influenced so we will be coming to that so often these things are quite complex it's not that that's straightforward correlation is there so how related to this and then we we discussed some of these things like online community moderation like a person is doing the AIDS page or some vulgar things or somebody is trying to influence the decisions like a forward what is the name like they try to push some particular agendas so it's broadly socially generic but especially politicians and government especially before the elections so these friends are quite calm so online community they try to pedal some particular narratives so that's what so I'm not taking sides of any politics but I'm just telling these things to happen okay and then the financial markets how to predict the share price and then blah blah so there is something called a supervised learning and a supervised learning and there is a reinforcement like,open_qa
9,How is statistical modeling used in online community moderation?,"Statistical models analyze text data to classify content as appropriate or inappropriate. They detect hate speech, misinformation, and harmful narratives by using supervised learning techniques.",1,1,in this course we are going to look at certain aspects of how to make sense of human data because data is not always straight so data is not always straight sometimes data is cute and then you know that to make sense of the particular data you know that if you have a question can anybody give an example like an essay data analysis in the real world? what sort of data analysis is big companies? what sort of analysis is it is in the idea? what you face in the real world? just just be some time in terms of the income of citizens so who will be interested in it? the government will be brought here so the U.J. is telling them income of citizens so based on that government will bring its policies and then they will take use and in this particular income line there are many people they need some support so that is good anyone answer from online? so any can anybody online experience the data analysis in real life? yes I think it is everyone had experience from data science is a previous semester because we had that acquisition of management cars and for myself I had some real work experience in text analysis okay you have experience in what field? a natural language process oh a natural language so can you just one or two lines? can you explain to the class what exactly what sort of data you analyzed and then what purpose you analyzed? in my question yeah you need not tell the details but at a high level you can just explain you said natural language was singed right? what sort of data you were collecting? I for natural language processing actually in this task I worked with with structure of web applications and I built some board metrics that convert text to array of list of numbers and develop neural networks for the analysis okay you are converting text to some arrays and then develop neural networks so what is the purpose of the neural network? like yes I appreciate you are going into the little bit detail of that okay you are using the text ultimately for what purpose? your neural network is doing some classification? yes it was classification was boundary specifications it is what I can talk about that we have for example two structure of elements of web application of value applications and neural networks should define its similar or not? okay it was actually a task of boundary classification okay you are doing the binary classification thank you so much so the result is giving this input so it was dealing data in the form of text usually it is a data in the form of income you know so income of residents of New York state so accordingly the state government can plan when the reactivity is open and some needs you know according so there is some text classification so probably one of the things of text classification is their 8th speech so especially these social media accounts you know so they they try to analyze what sort of you know posts you are doing and then immediately whether it falls into the category of killed or it's okay and then you know there is some objectionable thing so accordingly they try to censor it so you know so ultimately the thing is so they are trying to analyze the data every moment another thing like we can see is most of you might have experienced when you are doing some window shopping or online shopping you look for a particular product and then you don't you are not going to take it and you may take it later or you may just add it in the cart and leave it but at the same time you see that after three or four days when you are just browsing you get ads which are relevant to that particular product did you did you experience anything like that anytime so sometimes the ads are you know engineered as per our interest so this is some some sort of social engineering you are doing so this is based on the data they are collecting from our own browsing activities so the idea is there's a huge amount of data and then analyzing the data helps to enlarge each individual's business so that is the main purpose of this data and then we are doing lot of you know modeling of this particular data now the thing is the data whatever we have it's not always smooth and straightforward as it looks so we need to organize it properly for example if you are looking the browsing activity in a particular geographical location of the world so their needs will be different like suppose in all countries now people may be always looking for sweaters but when you are looking in and of dessert climate kind of like tropical countries which are close to equator so they will not be looking like various types of you know jerking and then all those things so when you are trying to understand the patterns buying patterns so you should collect the data accordingly now so the data you should not look for the data in a wrong place so what we are trying to say is data sometimes is skew so that's why whenever we are trying to do some sort of data analysis we should try to pick up our analysis techniques in a right way so I am just setting the precedent for the course so whatever we are discussing so they will be handling these indicate problems in data analysis so with this linear regression both simple and multiple and then these methods logistic regression and then non parameter regression and so on so the idea is these particular data modifications they will help further in machine learning this classifications just like Russell said so he is using some sort of text analysis and then all those things so that will go as an input to neural networks the neural networks are doing some sort of binary classification so similarly you know what is the pre processing data processing needed so that it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John this I have already uploaded a PDF and the Canvas course page is referred to that so that is the book so no need to run with the online videos so that is all not so you can just and then yeah so these are like broadly the distribution of grading every week you will be given an assignment to work on there will be deadlines so that will become according the particular person after the whole period so there will be one final exam that will be in around the first week of May or maybe end of April and yeah so that can be online or it will be hit person that can be at the side and there will be two projects so midterm and midterm project so there will be a presentation it's broadly this the details of midterm and midterm project I will upload after couple of weeks so this is it and then yeah the dates are there yeah you just get a idea of what we are broadly what we will broadly copy in this particular course so any questions still now before we go to the module one okay so let us go to today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be

they are trying to analyze the data every moment another thing like we can see is most of you might have experienced when you are doing some window shopping or online shopping you look for a particular product and then you don't you are not going to take it and you may take it later or you may just add it in the cart and leave it but at the same time you see that after three or four days when you are just browsing you get ads which are relevant to that particular product did you did you experience anything like that anytime so sometimes the ads are you know engineered as per our interest so this is some some sort of social engineering you are doing so this is based on the data they are collecting from our own browsing activities so the idea is there's a huge amount of data and then analyzing the data helps to enlarge each individual's business so that is the main purpose of this data and then we are doing lot of you know modeling of this particular data now the thing is the data whatever we have it's not always smooth and straightforward as it looks so we need to organize it properly for example if you are looking the browsing activity in a particular geographical location of the world so their needs will be different like suppose in all countries now people may be always looking for sweaters but when you are looking in and of dessert climate kind of like tropical countries which are close to equator so they will not be looking like various types of you know jerking and then all those things so when you are trying to understand the patterns buying patterns so you should collect the data accordingly now so the data you should not look for the data in a wrong place so what we are trying to say is data sometimes is skew so that's why whenever we are trying to do some sort of data analysis we should try to pick up our analysis techniques in a right way so I am just setting the precedent for the course so whatever we are discussing so they will be handling these indicate problems in data analysis so with this linear regression both simple and multiple and then these methods logistic regression and then non parameter regression and so on so the idea is these particular data modifications they will help further in machine learning this classifications just like Russell said so he is using some sort of text analysis and then all those things so that will go as an input to neural networks the neural networks are doing some sort of binary classification so similarly you know what is the pre processing data processing needed so that it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John this I have already uploaded a PDF and the Canvas course page is referred to that so that is the book so no need to run with the online videos so that is all not so you can just and then yeah so these are like broadly the distribution of grading every week you will be given an assignment to work on there will be deadlines so that will become according the particular person after the whole period so there will be one final exam that will be in around the first week of May or maybe end of April and yeah so that can be online or it will be hit person that can be at the side and there will be two projects so midterm and midterm project so there will be a presentation it's broadly this the details of midterm and midterm project I will upload after couple of weeks so this is it and then yeah the dates are there yeah you just get a idea of what we are broadly what we will broadly copy in this particular course so any questions still now before we go to the module one okay so let us go to today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be discussing something's left here so you just started with a very nice example that by the way the status gets up needed so you said very nice example that people collect income of the population so that they can plan the values that are activities accordingly how do you think you should copy it or any other similar example would you like to think or I wish by people collect standard those statistics like any other example anybody online also with respect to the social science think of you know demographics gender there are so many other things Professor can I go yeah yeah please so statistics we can use statistics for climate analysis so for gathering gathering the wind wind wind blow percentage and we can predict I mean there is a cyclone or something okay okay let's do this climate modeling so that's good yeah specifically that we say especially related to the society so we can think of something like this like people sometimes say that okay if you want to earn this particular income you know so what is the degree needed so how much education you have they try to map the income okay and sometimes people see that governments they are more what are the concerns for the government yes I wish one is to definitely provide them for activities to be any other any other thing which is which concerns the law income income anything else government is worried about the law enforcement yeah and then so crime rate of the control of the crime rate so government collects this particular data you know like a big cities you know like a very high levels of crime rate and then they try to correlate that particular dependent variable I mean like the crime rate on some observable maybe very okay why this is happening maybe because of lack of resources development or maybe because of poor education so like that so statistics are you know invent even in protocols society and then so there are obviously there are like various factors especially in human and in the accident so as the sites address so there are often multiple you know variables that are influencing the outcome of a particular way they are dependent variable and then there are observable variables so based on the observations we got from various variables a particular factor is influenced so we will be coming to that so often these things are quite complex it's not that that's straightforward correlation is there so how related to this and then we we discussed some of these things like online community moderation like a person is doing the AIDS page or some vulgar things or somebody is trying to influence the decisions like a forward what is the name like they try to push some particular agendas so it's broadly socially generic but especially politicians and government especially before the elections so these friends are quite calm so online community they try to pedal some particular narratives so that's what so I'm not taking sides of any politics but I'm just telling these things to happen okay and then the financial markets how to predict the share price and then blah blah so there is something called a supervised learning and a supervised learning and there is a

13,What is an example of a real-world data analysis problem in social science?,Governments analyze citizen income data to create policies that support low-income populations and allocate resources effectively.,1,1,in this course we are going to look at certain aspects of how to make sense of human data because data is not always straight so data is not always straight sometimes data is cute and then you know that to make sense of the particular data you know that if you have a question can anybody give an example like an essay data analysis in the real world? what sort of data analysis is big companies? what sort of analysis is it is in the idea? what you face in the real world? just just be some time in terms of the income of citizens so who will be interested in it? the government will be brought here so the U.J. is telling them income of citizens so based on that government will bring its policies and then they will take use and in this particular income line there are many people they need some support so that is good anyone answer from online? so any can anybody online experience the data analysis in real life? yes I think it is everyone had experience from data science is a previous semester because we had that acquisition of management cars and for myself I had some real work experience in text analysis okay you have experience in what field? a natural language process oh a natural language so can you just one or two lines? can you explain to the class what exactly what sort of data you analyzed and then what purpose you analyzed? in my question yeah you need not tell the details but at a high level you can just explain you said natural language was singed right? what sort of data you were collecting? I for natural language processing actually in this task I worked with with structure of web applications and I built some board metrics that convert text to array of list of numbers and develop neural networks for the analysis okay you are converting text to some arrays and then develop neural networks so what is the purpose of the neural network? like yes I appreciate you are going into the little bit detail of that okay you are using the text ultimately for what purpose? your neural network is doing some classification? yes it was classification was boundary specifications it is what I can talk about that we have for example two structure of elements of web application of value applications and neural networks should define its similar or not? okay it was actually a task of boundary classification okay you are doing the binary classification thank you so much so the result is giving this input so it was dealing data in the form of text usually it is a data in the form of income you know so income of residents of New York state so accordingly the state government can plan when the reactivity is open and some needs you know according so there is some text classification so probably one of the things of text classification is their 8th speech so especially these social media accounts you know so they they try to analyze what sort of you know posts you are doing and then immediately whether it falls into the category of killed or it's okay and then you know there is some objectionable thing so accordingly they try to censor it so you know so ultimately the thing is so they are trying to analyze the data every moment another thing like we can see is most of you might have experienced when you are doing some window shopping or online shopping you look for a particular product and then you don't you are not going to take it and you may take it later or you may just add it in the cart and leave it but at the same time you see that after three or four days when you are just browsing you get ads which are relevant to that particular product did you did you experience anything like that anytime so sometimes the ads are you know engineered as per our interest so this is some some sort of social engineering you are doing so this is based on the data they are collecting from our own browsing activities so the idea is there's a huge amount of data and then analyzing the data helps to enlarge each individual's business so that is the main purpose of this data and then we are doing lot of you know modeling of this particular data now the thing is the data whatever we have it's not always smooth and straightforward as it looks so we need to organize it properly for example if you are looking the browsing activity in a particular geographical

the idea is these particular data modifications they will help further in machine learning this classifications just like Russell said so he is using some sort of text analysis and then all those

it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John this I have already uploaded a PDF and the Canvas course page is referred to that so that is the book so no need to run with the online videos so that is all not so you can just and then yeah so these are like broadly the distribution of grading every week you will be given an assignment to work on there will be deadlines so that will become according the particular person after the whole period so there will be one final exam that will be in around the first week of May or maybe end of April and yeah so that can be online or it will be hit person that can be at the side and there will be two

14,How does supervised learning apply to social science data?,"Supervised learning can be used for text classification, such as identifying hate speech on social media or categorizing customer reviews in sentiment analysis.",1,1,in this course we are going to look at certain aspects of how to make sense of human data because data is not always straight so data is not always straight sometimes data is cute and then you know that to make sense of the particular data you know that if you have a question can anybody give an example like an essay data analysis in the real world? what sort of data analysis is big companies? what sort of analysis is it is in the idea? what you face in the real world? just just be some time in terms of the income of citizens so who will be interested in it? the government will be brought here so the U.J. is telling them income of citizens so based on that government will bring its policies and then they will take use and in this particular income line there are many people they need some support so that is good anyone answer from online? so any can anybody online experience the data analysis in real life? yes I think it is everyone had experience from data science is a previous semester because we had that acquisition of management cars and for myself I had some real work experience in text analysis okay you have experience in what field? a natural language process oh a natural language so can you just one or two lines? can you explain to the class what exactly what sort of data you analyzed and then what purpose you analyzed? in my question yeah you need not tell the details but at a high level you can just explain you said natural language was singed right? what sort of data you were collecting?

16,What is the significance of demographic data in social science modeling?,"Demographic data, such as age, gender, and education level, helps governments and businesses understand societal trends, make economic forecasts, and tailor services to different populations.",1,1,in this course we are going to look at certain aspects of how to make sense of human data because data is not always straight so data is not always straight sometimes data is cute and then you know that to make sense of the particular data you know that if you have a question can anybody give an example like an essay data analysis in the real world? what sort of data analysis is big companies? what sort of analysis is it is in the idea? what you face in the real world? just just be some time in terms of the income of citizens so who will be interested in it? the government will be brought here so the U.J. is telling them income of citizens so based on that government will bring its policies and then they will take use and in this particular income line there are many people they need some support so that is good anyone answer from online? so any can anybody online experience the data analysis in real life? yes I think it is everyone had experience from data science is a previous semester because we had that acquisition of management cars and for myself I had some real work experience in text analysis okay you have experience in what field? a natural language process oh a natural language so can you just one or two lines? can you explain to the class what exactly what sort of data you analyzed and then what purpose you analyzed? in my question yeah you need not tell the details but at a high level you can just explain you said natural language was singed right? what sort of data you were collecting? I for natural language processing actually in this task I worked with with structure of web applications and I built some board metrics that convert text to array of list of numbers and develop neural networks for the analysis okay you are converting text to some arrays and then develop neural networks so what is the purpose of the neural network? like yes I appreciate you are going into the little bit detail of that okay you are using the text ultimately for what purpose? your neural network is doing some classification? yes it was classification was boundary specifications it is what I can talk about that we have for example two structure of elements of web application of value applications and neural networks should define its similar or not? okay it was actually a task of boundary classification okay you are doing the binary classification thank you so much so the result is giving this input so it was dealing data in the form of text usually it is a data in the form of income you know so income of residents of New York state so accordingly the state government can plan when the reactivity is open and some needs you know according so there is some text classification so probably one of the things of text classification is their 8th speech so especially these social media accounts you know so they they try to analyze what sort of you know posts you are doing and then immediately whether it falls into the category of killed or it's okay and then you know there is some objectionable thing so accordingly they try to censor it so you know so ultimately the thing is so they are trying to analyze the data every moment another thing like we can see is most of you might have experienced when you are doing some window shopping or online shopping you look for a particular product and then you don't you are not going to take it and you may take it later or you may just add it in the cart and leave it but at the same time you see that after three or four days when you are just browsing you get ads which are relevant to that particular product did you did you experience anything like that anytime so sometimes the ads are you know engineered as per our interest so this is some some sort of social engineering you are doing so this is based on the data they are collecting from our own browsing activities so the idea is there's a huge amount of data and then analyzing the data helps to enlarge each individual's business so that is the main purpose of this data and then we are doing lot of you know modeling of this particular data now the thing is the data whatever we have it's not always smooth and straightforward as it looks so we need to organize it properly for example if you are looking the browsing activity in a particular geographical location of the world so their needs will be different like suppose in all countries now people may be always looking for sweaters but when you are looking in and of dessert climate kind of like tropical countries which are close to equator so they will not be looking like various types of you know jerking and then all those things so when you are trying to understand the patterns buying patterns so you should collect the data accordingly now so the data you should not look for the data in a wrong place so what we are trying to say is data sometimes is skew so that's why whenever we are trying to do some sort of data analysis we should try to pick up our analysis techniques in a right way so I am just setting the precedent for the course so whatever we are discussing so they will be handling these indicate problems in data analysis so with this linear regression both simple and multiple and then these methods logistic regression and then non parameter regression and so on so the idea is these particular data modifications they will help further in machine learning this classifications just like Russell said so he is using some sort of text analysis and then all those things so that will go as an input to neural networks the neural networks are doing some sort of binary classification so similarly you know what is the pre processing data processing needed so that it will help in various classification techniques so that is what we are going to see in the next 8 to 10 models so here is the introduction and then so this is the standard textbook for books John this I have already uploaded a PDF and the Canvas course page is referred to that so that is the book so no need to run with the online videos so that is all not so you can just and then yeah so these are like broadly the distribution of grading every week you will be given an assignment to work on there will be deadlines so that will become according the particular person after the whole period so there will be one final exam that will be in around the first week of May or maybe end of April and yeah so that can be online or it will be hit person that can be at the side and there will be two projects so midterm and midterm project so there will be a presentation it's broadly this the details of midterm and midterm project I will upload after couple of weeks so this is it and then yeah the dates are there yeah you just get a idea of what we are broadly what we will broadly copy in this particular course so any questions still now before we go to the module one okay so let us go to today's discussion I uploaded the slide and lecture notes so you can those are on to see the lecture notes and you know most of your joining up so slide sharing okay I hope you are able to see my PDF whatever I am sharing okay you did right yeah you're able to see the video your name please I wish okay I should be the one yeah okay thank you so yeah today's lecture next half-leave we will be discussing something's left here so you just started with a very nice example that by the way the status gets up needed so you said very nice example that people collect income of the population so that they can plan the values that are activities accordingly how do you think you should copy it or any other similar example would you like to think or I wish by people collect standard those statistics like any other example anybody online also with respect to the social science think of you know demographics gender there are so many other things Professor can I go yeah yeah please so statistics we can use statistics for climate analysis so for gathering gathering the wind wind wind blow percentage and we can predict I mean there is a cyclone or something okay okay let's do this climate modeling so that's good yeah specifically that we say especially related to the society so we can think of something like this like people sometimes say that okay if you want to earn this particular income you know so what is the degree needed so how much education you have they try to map the income okay and sometimes people see that governments they are more what are the concerns for the government yes I wish one is to definitely provide them for activities to be any other any other thing which is which concerns the law income income anything else government is worried about the law enforcement yeah and then so crime rate of the control of the crime rate so government collects this particular data you know like a big cities you know like a very high levels of crime rate and then they try to correlate that particular dependent variable I mean like the crime rate on some observable maybe very okay why this is happening maybe because of lack of resources development or maybe because of poor education so like that so statistics are you know invent even in protocols society and then so there are obviously there are like various factors especially in human and in the accident so as the sites address so there are often multiple you know variables that are influencing the outcome of a particular way they are dependent variable and then there are observable variables so based on the observations we got from various variables a particular factor is influenced so we will be coming to that so often these things are quite complex it's not that that's straightforward correlation is there so how related to this and then we we discussed some of these things like online community moderation like a person is doing the AIDS page or some vulgar things or somebody is trying to influence the decisions like a forward what is the name like they try to push some particular agendas so it's broadly socially generic but especially politicians and government especially before the elections so these friends are quite calm so online community they try to pedal some particular narratives so that's what so I'm not taking sides of any politics but I'm just telling these things to happen okay and then the financial markets how to predict the share price and then blah blah so there is something called a supervised learning and a supervised learning and there is a reinforcement like,open_qa
17,How is text data used for social analysis?,"Text analysis is used in sentiment analysis, political opinion mining, and news classification to understand public sentiment and detect trends in social issues.",1,1,in this course we are going to look at certain aspects of how to make sense of human data because data is not always straight so data is not always straight sometimes data is cute and then you know that to make sense of the particular data you know that if you have a question can anybody give an example like an essay data analysis in the real world? what sort of data analysis is big companies? what sort of analysis is it is in the idea? what you face in the real world? just just be some time in terms of the income of citizens so who will be interested in it? the government will be brought here so the U.J. is telling them income of citizens so based on that government will bring its policies and then they will take use and in this particular income line there are many people they need some support so that is good anyone answer from online? so any can anybody online experience the data analysis in real life? yes I think it is everyone had experience from data science is a previous semester because we had that acquisition of management cars and for myself I had some real work experience in text analysis okay you have experience in what field? a natural language process oh a natural language so can you just one or two lines? can you explain to the class what exactly what sort of data you analyzed and then what purpose you analyzed? in my question yeah you need not tell the details but at a high level you can just explain you said natural language was singed right? what sort of data you were collecting?

18,What are some challenges in applying statistical models to social science?,"Challenges include:
 1. Data bias (social data can be biased, leading to incorrect predictions).

19,Can you explain this slide?,"This slide explains the importance of modeling in statistical analysis and social science. It highlights two primary purposes of modeling: prediction/estimation (e.g., weather forecasting, fraud detection, stock price prediction) and control (e.g., taking action based on predictions, such as blocking fraudulent transactions or administering medical treatments).",2,1,so all these things need these statistics okay so a lot of theories that today little bit please bear with me some theory and then there is some mathematics at the end but hopefully in next module onwards we jump more into the next part of it so brought me we are trying to do some sort of model so somebody answered I'm sorry go answer I see but yeah so they there's some sort of model okay so recently there is a bomb cyclone and a bomb Arctic so they try to model okay there's going to be every one for the next three four days so because of that they are able to control so one is prediction prediction military training to go there we are small fall etc so that is prediction but based on the prediction another government can plan for control steps so that is the idea you know always there's a prediction in control so control is the responsive action what you have to take so because of the excess snowfall the social life got disturbed and there is so much of chaos in society especially people were rooting because there's lack of the basicness cities so the police should be know by effective prediction the control mechanisms can be the correct plan so so most any of you experience this let us take from online so this fraudulent detection you know so did any of you experience this particular accident this transaction fraudulent anybody from online here okay I'll share an example like okay there's something in the chat one of my okay I'll sit together so he's telling them one of his friend experience would you like to share what is the experience city you can unmute and then share you like to share I prefer you mean she and hand so there's calli safety side who are so he shared something in the chat one of my audio is not audible okay no problem thank you so next time please fix it we would like to hear what is the yeah yeah you want to share something but there's something to say the action time yes you mean the experience in statistic analysis sorry I can't hear you clearly Transactions oh I don't have the kind of experience I think the the sound didn't work now because it's really hard to clear clearly to to hear you okay no I think it didn't work so far anybody else is facing oh yes that that's clear okay yeah okay so we were trying to purchase something in the building was quite high you know I don't think I don't know something like that so and then we inserted so it did not work at the first attempt so they said that this transaction appears in the credit card so we know that the card is modified and we wanted to purchase it and the store was about to close 755 but we were an anxiety so we were practically cursing our bank chase why are we in line but they have a certain historical data how much we are spending and all not so based on that we said that okay look you're spending should be within this limit and if it is beyond that so they raised a fraudulent killer it's not that they denied it but they sent a message so they have a control technique the control technique is they sent a message to the app on the mobile if you are purchasing this you know if this transaction is straightforward then press blah blah so when we press that then the next time when we do that so they are here is this fraudulent transaction so based on the historical data they do some sort of prediction so that our own account is not compromised so like that and then patient is sick so this is this is very much previously people used to get this x-ray done and then the x-ray was used by the doctor to see so nowadays there are more you know everything is digital and then there is AI which is going to look at the images and then predictive the person is standing COVID blah blah it's cancer so yeah so these are things and then accordingly that will be a treatment so yeah okay so calli said we wrote yes my friend used to purchase the product from all the other stuff more discount after adding screen shows complete amount data from that or after the same bit exposes to this paper yeah thank you thank you appreciate it okay we need to move fast okay sorry yeah so,summarization

 What is observational data?","Observational data is measured, collected, logged, scraped, or monitored. It is used for prediction and estimation, such as predicting the weather.",2,1,so all these things need these statistics okay so a lot of theories that today little bit please bear with me some theory and then there is some mathematics at the end but hopefully in next module onwards we jump more into the next part of it so brought me we are trying to do some sort of model so somebody answered I'm sorry go answer I see but yeah so they there's some sort of model okay so recently there is a bomb cyclone and a bomb Arctic so they try to model okay there's going to be every one for the next three four days so because of that they are able to control so one is prediction prediction military training to go there we are small fall etc so that is prediction but based on the prediction another government can plan for control steps so that is the idea you know always there's a prediction in control so control is the responsive action what you have to take so because of the excess snowfall the social life got disturbed and there is so much of chaos in society especially people were rooting because there's lack of the basicness cities so the police should be know by effective prediction the control mechanisms can be the correct plan so so most any of you experience this let us take from online so this fraudulent detection you know so did any of you experience this particular accident this transaction fraudulent anybody from online here okay I'll share an example like okay there's something in the chat one of my okay I'll sit together so he's telling them one of his friend experience would you like to share what is the experience city you can unmute and then share you like to share I prefer you mean she and hand so there's calli safety side who are so he shared something in the chat one of my audio is not audible okay no problem thank you so next time please fix it we would like to hear what is the yeah yeah you want to share something but there's something to say the action time yes you mean the experience in statistic analysis sorry I can't hear you clearly Transactions oh I don't have the kind of experience I think the the sound didn't work now because it's really hard to clear clearly to to hear you okay no I think it didn't work so far anybody else is facing oh yes that that's clear okay yeah okay so we were trying to purchase something in the building was quite high you know I don't think I don't know something like that so and then we inserted so it did not work at the first attempt so they said that this transaction appears in the credit card so we know that the card is modified and we wanted to purchase it and the store was about to close 755 but we were an anxiety so we were practically cursing our bank chase why are we in line but they have a certain historical data how much we are spending and all not so based on that we said that okay look you're spending should be within this limit and if it is beyond that so they raised a fraudulent killer it's not that they denied it but they sent a message so they have a control technique the control technique is they sent a message to the app on the mobile if you are purchasing this you know if this transaction is straightforward then press blah blah so when we press that then the next time when we do that so they are here is this fraudulent transaction so based on the historical data they do some sort of prediction so that our own account is not compromised so like that and then patient is sick so this is this is very much previously people used to get this x-ray done and then the x-ray was used by the doctor to see so nowadays there are more you know everything is digital and then there is AI which is going to look at the images and then predictive the person is standing COVID blah blah it's cancer so yeah so these are things and then accordingly that will be a treatment so yeah okay so calli said we wrote yes my friend used to purchase the product from all the other stuff more discount after adding screen shows complete amount data from that or after the same bit exposes to this paper yeah thank you thank you appreciate it okay we need to move fast okay sorry yeah so,closed_qa

115,Can you explain this slide?,This slide poses a critical question about when the mean is a good estimate for a given value yi. It explores the conditions under which the mean provides an accurate summary versus when it fails due to factors like outliers or skewed data.,8,1,now the question is is this particular way of estimating is it good or bad no like estimating a mean is it good or bad any any any thoughts yes with or what do you think let me let me keep the question simple okay so like so let us come to this question of your jt and whatever you just said so there is an income okay there is there are 10 people okay let's simplify this there are only 10 people you are trying to observe okay and then you say that in order to estimate the income I just take a mean okay and then based on that you know the error will be there's an error we start now there's a mean and then there is a type of a deed sample do you think the mean is a good estimate by he says but well is telling that mean is not a good estimate by you understand okay you just telling that there will be some out there can you explain what was yes yes yes so I'm repeating because all is not able to capture your voice yeah so you just telling that suppose there are this 10 people and then you try to you know you find the mean as the estimate decide mean as the estimate so then nine of the people are only one dollar and one person is earning thousand dollars so the average you know will be something like close to 100 but most of the people who design of the people you know and they're even the outlier also so he's like so it's not a reasonable estimate because the error is too high for each of the cases okay so then when when it is good when there are more outliers you know when more or less reasonably you know everybody is having a more or less same income like a close plus or minus 10 percent so then it is reasonable so which may not be the case always okay so that is why we are saying that always mean doesn't work you know but sometimes it is better and sometimes so now,summarization
116,When is the mean a good estimate of yi ?,"The mean is a good estimate when the data points are relatively close to each other, meaning there is low variance and minimal outliers.",8,1,now the question is is this particular way of estimating is it good or bad no like estimating a mean is it good or bad any any any thoughts yes with or what do you think let me let me keep the question simple okay so like so let us come to this question of your jt and whatever you just said so there is an income okay there is there are 10 people okay let's simplify this there are only 10 people you are trying to observe okay and then you say that in order to estimate the income I just take a mean okay and then based on that you know the error will be there's an error we start now there's a mean and then there is a type of a deed sample do you think the mean is a good estimate by he says but well is telling that mean is not a good estimate by you understand okay you just telling that there will be some out there can you explain what was yes yes yes so I'm repeating because all is not able to capture your voice yeah so you just telling that suppose there are this 10 people and then you try to you know you find the mean as the estimate decide mean as the estimate so then nine of the people are only one dollar and one person is earning thousand dollars so the average you know will be something like close to 100 but most of the people who design of the people you know and they're even the outlier also so he's like so it's not a reasonable estimate because the error is too high for each of the cases okay so then when when it is good when there are more outliers you know when more or less reasonably you know everybody is having a more or less same income like a close plus or minus 10 percent so then it is reasonable so which may not be the case always okay so that is why we are saying that always mean doesn't work you know but sometimes it is better and sometimes so now,closed_qa

119,Can you provide an example where the mean is misleading?,"Yes, if we measure the incomes of 10 people where 9 earn $10,000 annually and one earns $1,000,000, the mean income would be highly inflated and not representative of most people in the group.",8,1,now the question is is this particular way of estimating is it good or bad no like estimating a mean is it good or bad any any any thoughts yes with or what do you think let me let me keep the question simple okay so like so let us come to this question of your jt and whatever you just said so there is an income okay there is there are 10 people okay let's simplify this there are only 10 people you are trying to observe okay and then you say that in order to estimate the income I just take a mean okay and then based on that you know the error will be there's an error we start now there's a mean and then there is a type of a deed sample do you think the mean is a good estimate by he says but well is telling that mean is not a good estimate by you understand okay you just telling that there will be some out there can you explain what was yes yes yes so I'm repeating because all is not able to capture your voice yeah so you just telling that suppose there are this 10 people and then you try to you know you find the mean as the estimate decide mean as the estimate so then nine of the people are only one dollar and one person is earning thousand dollars so the average you know will be something like close to 100 but most of the people who design of the people you know and they're even the outlier also so he's like so it's not a reasonable estimate because the error is too high for each of the cases okay so then when when it is good when there are more outliers you know when more or less reasonably you know everybody is having a more or less same income like a close plus or minus 10 percent so then it is reasonable so which may not be the case always okay so that is why we are saying that always mean doesn't work you know but sometimes it is better and sometimes so now,information_extraction
120,What alternative statistical measures can be used when the mean is misleading?,"When the mean is affected by outliers, the median (the middle value) and the mode (most frequent value) are often better indicators of central tendency.",8,1,now the question is is this particular way of estimating is it good or bad no like estimating a mean is it good or bad any any any thoughts yes with or what do you think let me let me keep the question simple okay so like so let us come to this question of your jt and whatever you just said so there is an income okay there is there are 10 people okay let's simplify this there are only 10 people you are trying to observe okay and then you say that in order to estimate the income I just take a mean okay and then based on that you know the error will be there's an error we start now there's a mean and then there is a type of a deed sample do you think the mean is a good estimate by he says but well is telling that mean is not a good estimate by you understand okay you just telling that there will be some out there can you explain what was yes yes yes so I'm repeating because all is not able to capture your voice yeah so you just telling that suppose there are this 10 people and then you try to you know you find the mean as the estimate decide mean as the estimate so then nine of the people are only one dollar and one person is earning thousand dollars so the average you know will be something like close to 100 but most of the people who design of the people you know and they're even the outlier also so he's like so it's not a reasonable estimate because the error is too high for each of the cases okay so then when when it is good when there are more outliers you know when more or less reasonably you know everybody is having a more or less same income like a close plus or minus 10 percent so then it is reasonable so which may not be the case always okay so that is why we are saying that always mean doesn't work you know but sometimes it is better and sometimes so now,closed_qa
121,How does variance relate to the reliability of the mean as an estimate?,"A high variance suggests that data points are widely spread out, making the mean less reliable as a summary. A low variance means that most values are close to the mean, making it a more accurate estimate.",8,1,now the question is is this particular way of estimating is it good or bad no like estimating a mean is it good or bad any any any thoughts yes with or what do you think let me let me keep the question simple okay so like so let us come to this question of your jt and whatever you just said so there is an income okay there is there are 10 people okay let's simplify this there are only 10 people you are trying to observe okay and then you say that in order to estimate the income I just take a mean okay and then based on that you know the error will be there's an error we start now there's a mean and then there is a type of a deed sample do you think the mean is a good estimate by he says but well is telling that mean is not a good estimate by you understand okay you just telling that there will be some out there can you explain what was yes yes yes so I'm repeating because all is not able to capture your voice yeah so you just telling that suppose there are this 10 people and then you try to you know you find the mean as the estimate decide mean as the estimate so then nine of the people are only one dollar and one person is earning thousand dollars so the average you know will be something like close to 100 but most of the people who design of the people you know and they're even the outlier also so he's like so it's not a reasonable estimate because the error is too high for each of the cases okay so then when when it is good when there are more outliers you know when more or less reasonably you know everybody is having a more or less same income like a close plus or minus 10 percent so then it is reasonable so which may not be the case always okay so that is why we are saying that always mean doesn't work you know but sometimes it is better and sometimes so now,open_qa
122,How do real-world applications account for cases where the mean is misleading?,"In finance, economists often use the median income instead of the mean income to avoid distortion caused by a few very high earners. Similarly, in housing markets, median home prices are preferred over mean prices.",8,1,now the question is is this particular way of estimating is it good or bad no like estimating a mean is it good or bad any any any thoughts yes with or what do you think let me let me keep the question simple okay so like so let us come to this question of your jt and whatever you just said so there is an income okay there is there are 10 people okay let's simplify this there are only 10 people you are trying to observe okay and then you say that in order to estimate the income I just take a mean okay and then based on that you know the error will be there's an error we start now there's a mean and then there is a type of a deed sample do you think the mean is a good estimate by he says but well is telling that mean is not a good estimate by you understand okay you just telling that there will be some out there can you explain what was yes yes yes so I'm repeating because all is not able to capture your voice yeah so you just telling that suppose there are this 10 people and then you try to you know you find the mean as the estimate decide mean as the estimate so then nine of the people are only one dollar and one person is earning thousand dollars so the average you know will be something like close to 100 but most of the people who design of the people you know and they're even the outlier also so he's like so it's not a reasonable estimate because the error is too high for each of the cases okay so then when when it is good when there are more outliers you know when more or less reasonably you know everybody is having a more or less same income like a close plus or minus 10 percent so then it is reasonable so which may not be the case always okay so that is why we are saying that always mean doesn't work you know but sometimes it is better and sometimes so now,information_extraction
123,What statistical concept helps determine whether the mean is appropriate for a dataset?,"The concept of data distribution is key. If the data follows a normal distribution, the mean is a good estimate. If the data is skewed, then alternative measures like the median should be considered.",8,1,now the question is is this particular way of estimating is it good or bad no like estimating a mean is it good or bad any any any thoughts yes with or what do you think let me let me keep the question simple okay so like so let us come to this question of your jt and whatever you just said so there is an income okay there is there are 10 people okay let's simplify this there are only 10 people you are trying to observe okay and then you say that in order to estimate the income I just take a mean okay and then based on that you know the error will be there's an error we start now there's a mean and then there is a type of a deed sample do you think the mean is a good estimate by he says but well is telling that mean is not a good estimate by you understand okay you just telling that there will be some out there can you explain what was yes yes yes so I'm repeating because all is not able to capture your voice yeah so you just telling that suppose there are this 10 people and then you try to you know you find the mean as the estimate decide mean as the estimate so then nine of the people are only one dollar and one person is earning thousand dollars so the average you know will be something like close to 100 but most of the people who design of the people you know and they're even the outlier also so he's like so it's not a reasonable estimate because the error is too high for each of the cases okay so then when when it is good when there are more outliers you know when more or less reasonably you know everybody is having a more or less same income like a close plus or minus 10 percent so then it is reasonable so which may not be the case always okay so that is why we are saying that always mean doesn't work you know but sometimes it is better and sometimes so now,closed_qa
124,Why does this discussion matter in regression analysis?,"In regression, we often make predictions based on averages, but if the mean is misleading, the model might produce inaccurate results. Understanding when the mean is a good estimate helps improve data modeling and decision-making.",8,1,now the question is is this particular way of estimating is it good or bad no like estimating a mean is it good or bad any any any thoughts yes with or what do you think let me let me keep the question simple okay so like so let us come to this question of your jt and whatever you just said so there is an income okay there is there are 10 people okay let's simplify this there are only 10 people you are trying to observe okay and then you say that in order to estimate the income I just take a mean okay and then based on that you know the error will be there's an error we start now there's a mean and then there is a type of a deed sample do you think the mean is a good estimate by he says but well is telling that mean is not a good estimate by you understand okay you just telling that there will be some out there can you explain what was yes yes yes so I'm repeating because all is not able to capture your voice yeah so you just telling that suppose there are this 10 people and then you try to you know you find the mean as the estimate decide mean as the estimate so then nine of the people are only one dollar and one person is earning thousand dollars so the average you know will be something like close to 100 but most of the people who design of the people you know and they're even the outlier also so he's like so it's not a reasonable estimate because the error is too high for each of the cases okay so then when when it is good when there are more outliers you know when more or less reasonably you know everybody is having a more or less same income like a close plus or minus 10 percent so then it is reasonable so which may not be the case always okay so that is why we are saying that always mean doesn't work you know but sometimes it is better and sometimes so now,open_qa

140,Can you explain this slide?,"This slide introduces nonparametric regression, which is an approach that does not assume a fixed functional form for the relationship between variables. It contrasts with linear regression and explains how naive non-parametric methods work using bins of x and means of y.",10,1,"the relationship in data may not always be linear. In such cases, we can use non-parametric methods, such as binning, to analyze continuous data. Let’s revisit the example of rental prices for one-bedroom units in Manhattan.
The dataset includes rental prices ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 or even $20,000. If we sum up all the units represented on the Y-axis, we get a total of 10,000 units. The key question here is: how do we define the bin size? If I understand correctly, the bin size in this example is approximately $250. That means prices are grouped into ranges like $750–$1,000, $1,000–$1,250, $1,250–$1,500, and so on. Within each bin, we count how many rental units fall into that price range. For instance, in the range of $2,500–$2,750, there are around 900 units. The choice of bin size determines how much detail we retain or lose in the data representation. If we increase the number of bins, we get finer granularity but may also introduce more variance. Conversely, if we reduce the number of bins, we oversimplify the data, potentially losing meaningful patterns.
Suppose we chose a single bin that includes all 10,000 rental units—what would happen?

156,Can you explain this slide?,"This slide discusses bias and variance in nonparametric regression. Bias represents systematic error due to model simplifications, while variance refers to random error that increases with sensitivity to small fluctuations. The slide explains how increasing model complexity (more bins) reduces bias but increases variance, whereas adding more samples reduces variance.",10,1,"the relationship in data may not always be linear. In such cases, we can use non-parametric methods, such as binning, to analyze continuous data. Let’s revisit the example of rental prices for one-bedroom units in Manhattan.
The dataset includes rental prices ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 or even $20,000. If we sum up all the units represented on the Y-axis, we get a total of 10,000 units. The key question here is: how do we define the bin size? If I understand correctly, the bin size in this example is approximately $250. That means prices are grouped into ranges like $750–$1,000, $1,000–$1,250, $1,250–$1,500, and so on. Within each bin, we count how many rental units fall into that price range. For instance, in the range of $2,500–$2,750, there are around 900 units. The choice of bin size determines how much detail we retain or lose in the data representation. If we increase the number of bins, we get finer granularity but may also introduce more variance. Conversely, if we reduce the number of bins, we oversimplify the data, potentially losing meaningful patterns.
Suppose we chose a single bin that includes all 10,000 rental units—what would happen?

157,What is bias in the context of regression?,"Bias is the inverse of accuracy, representing how far the model's predictions deviate systematically from the true values.

158,What is variance in regression analysis?,"Variance refers to the inverse of precision, representing the spread of model predictions for different training sets. High variance occurs when the model is too complex, making it sensitive to small changes in the data.",11,1,"What are the advantages and disadvantages of bin size when representing data? There are two main issues: bias and variance. When choosing the number of bins, we need to balance these two factors. Let’s assume we have a dataset with 10,000 observations. We can divide this dataset into bins of equal width, such as 20 or 25 bins. However, we could also increase the number of bins to 250. What happens in each case? If we assume that there are 20 bins, we can analyze how data is distributed across them. Now, what will happen if we increase the number of bins to 200 or 250? The curve will flatten, and the figures will become thinner and denser.
Take this histogram as an example. It represents the monthly rent for one-bedroom apartments. If the bin size is $250, then for the $1,000–$1,250 range, there may be 60 rental units, and for the $1,250–$1,500 range, there may be 80 rental units. With 20 or 25 bins, the data maintains a clear distribution. However, if we increase the number of bins to 200 or 250, the maximum frequency count, which was previously around 1,000, may drop to 200 or even 100. What does this mean? It means that as the number of bins increases, the number of data points in each bin decreases. This leads to higher variance, making the dataset more fragmented and sensitive to fluctuations. That is why we always recommend training models on large datasets—having more data helps in reducing variance and improving generalization. Conversely, if we use fewer bins, the model becomes highly biased because it over-simplifies the data. Suppose we are analyzing winter clothing purchases. If we only collect data from hot climate regions and include very little data from cold climate regions, our model will conclude that people do not buy winter clothing, which is incorrect and biased. Thus, having too many bins increases variance, while having too few bins increases bias. The goal is to find an optimal bin size that maintains a balance between bias and variance, ensuring that the data representation is accurate, meaningful, and useful for decision-making.

If the bin size is $250, then for the $1,000–$1,250 range, there may be 60 rental units, and for the $1,250–$1,500 range, there may be 80 rental units. With 20 or 25 bins, the data maintains a clear distribution. However, if we increase the number of bins to 200 or 250, the maximum frequency count, which was previously around 1,000, may drop to 200 or even 100. What does this mean? It means that as the number of bins increases, the number of data points in each bin decreases. This leads to higher variance, making the dataset more fragmented and sensitive to fluctuations. That is why we always recommend training models on large datasets—having more data helps in reducing variance and improving generalization. Conversely, if we use fewer bins, the model becomes highly biased because it over-simplifies the data. Suppose we are analyzing winter clothing purchases. If we only collect data from hot climate regions and include very little data from cold climate regions, our model will conclude that people do not buy winter clothing, which is incorrect and biased. Thus, having too many bins increases variance, while having too few bins increases bias. The goal is to find an optimal bin size that maintains a balance between bias and variance, ensuring that the data representation is accurate, meaningful, and useful for decision-making. ",open_qa
171,Can you explain this slide?,This slide explains how bin size affects nonparametric regression by demonstrating the impact of different bin counts on bias and variance. It shows how choosing the right number of bins is crucial for accurate regression analysis.,11,1,"What are the advantages and disadvantages of bin size when representing data? There are two main issues: bias and variance. When choosing the number of bins, we need to balance these two factors. Let’s assume we have a dataset with 10,000 observations. We can divide this dataset into bins of equal width, such as 20 or 25 bins. However, we could also increase the number of bins to 250. What happens in each case? If we assume that there are 20 bins, we can analyze how data is distributed across them. Now, what will happen if we increase the number of bins to 200 or 250? The curve will flatten, and the figures will become thinner and denser.

172,What do the three plots represent in terms of bin size?,"The three plots show how different bin sizes (10, 30, and 100) affect the fitted regression curve.",12,1,"Let’s take a closer look at this figure to gain further clarity. We have several sample observations, and the data is divided into bins. By examining the figure, what can we infer from the distribution? Take a moment to analyze the plot before sharing your observations.
One key observation is that as the number of bins increases, precision decreases. This can be seen clearly in the figure where the number of bins is 100—the model's behavior becomes more erratic, and the description of the data is poor. The variance also increases significantly. In contrast, when the bin count is 10 or 30, the model appears more stable. The key takeaway is that choosing too many or too few bins can impact the accuracy of data representation. Now, let’s analyze the first figure. What do you think is the issue with bin count 10? One observation is that the number of bins is too small, making the curve appear coarse and oversimplified. However, even at 100 bins, the model exhibits erratic fluctuations due to excessive variance. When the bin count is too low, the model suffers from high bias, as data points are grouped into broad categories, losing finer details. Suppose we reduced the bins further to just two—this would result in even more oversimplification, as most data points would be forced into just two broad categories, making meaningful analysis impossible.
On the other hand, increasing the number of bins significantly reduces bias but increases variance. This is because each bin contains fewer data points, making the distribution more sensitive to fluctuations. A larger dataset can help mitigate variance, but an optimal bin count is still necessary to strike a balance between bias and variance.
One key insight is that bin size affects model precision. If the bin count is too small, the model oversimplifies data, while if the bin count is too high, the model becomes unstable due to high variance. Let’s discuss one specific case—if the bin size is 10, we observe overfitting, where the curve is strongly influenced by the data, leading to excessive sensitivity. For example, if the bin count is too low, the model groups many observations together, making it easier to analyze trends but sacrificing details. However, as the number of bins increases, the curve smooths out. If the bin count is too high, the model captures too much noise, leading to an unstable representation of the data.

Bias refers to how much the model’s predictions deviate from actual values. If the bin count is too low, the model exhibits high bias, meaning it oversimplifies data and fails to capture important variations.

Now, let’s clarify why bias reduces when the bin count increases. If you look at the two figures, one represents a dataset with a large bin size (fewer bins), and the other represents a dataset with a smaller bin size (more bins). When bin sizes are large (fewer bins), bias is high because data points are aggregated into broader categories, leading to less detailed insights. However, when bin sizes are small (more bins), variance increases because each bin has fewer elements, making the model more sensitive to random fluctuations.
The final takeaway is that choosing the right bin size is essential for achieving a balance between bias and variance. If we have too few bins, the model oversimplifies the data, losing crucial details. If we have too many bins, the model overfits, capturing too much variance and making predictions unstable. The goal is to find an optimal number of bins where data representation is accurate, meaningful, and useful for analysis.

186,What does variance represent in nonparametric regression?,Variance measures the sensitivity of the model to small fluctuations in data. High variance means the model is too sensitive to individual data points.,13,1,"Let’s also consider the relationship between bias and variance in this context. Bias refers to how much the model’s predictions deviate from actual values. If the bin count is too low, the model exhibits high bias, meaning it oversimplifies data and fails to capture important variations. However, as we increase the number of bins, bias decreases, but variance increases.
Now, let’s clarify why bias reduces when the bin count increases. If you look at the two figures, one represents a dataset with a large bin size (fewer bins), and the other represents a dataset with a smaller bin size (more bins). When bin sizes are large (fewer bins), bias is high because data points are aggregated into broader categories, leading to less detailed insights. However, when bin sizes are small (more bins), variance increases because each bin has fewer elements, making the model more sensitive to random fluctuations.
The final takeaway is that choosing the right bin size is essential for achieving a balance between bias and variance. If we have too few bins, the model oversimplifies the data, losing crucial details. If we have too many bins, the model overfits, capturing too much variance and making predictions unstable. The goal is to find an optimal number of bins where data representation is accurate, meaningful, and useful for analysis.",closed_qa

However, since σϵ is unknown in practice, we need to estimate it. To estimate the error variance, we use the formula:S E2= (n−2)∑iE i2 where Ei represents the residuals. This estimate provides an approximation of σϵ, ensuring that our regression analysis remains statistically sound.The key takeaway from this slide is that while we cannot directly observe σϵ, we can estimate it using residuals, which allows us to quantify the variability in our regression coefficients.",general_qa

In other words, if we square the t-statistic, we get the corresponding F-statistic.The F-test is particularly useful when comparing two models with different subsets of regressors. Let's say:
Model 1 is a more complex model with additional regressors.
Model 0 is a simpler model with fewer regressors.
To perform the F-test, we fit both models and calculate the Regression Sum of Squares (RegSS):RegSS1 for Model 1 (more complex)RegSS0
​for Model 0 (simpler)
Since Model 1 contains more regressors, it should always have a higher regression sum of squares than Model 0:RegSS1>RegSS0

​Here, RegSS₁ and RegSS₀ represent the regression sum of squares for the more complex and simpler models, respectively. q is the difference in the number of regressors between the two models, and k is the number of regressors in the larger model.
The F-test is valid when RegSS₁ > RegSS₀, meaning that the larger model explains more variance in the data than the simpler one. By comparing the F-statistic to a critical value from the F-distribution, we can assess whether the added regressors contribute significantly to the model.
If the calculated F-statistic is large enough, we reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the additional regressors significantly improve the model.

So the points are there. You know. So and then this one. There's a correlation between X1 and X2. It's a projection. Right. So what I'm trying to say is like the projection is linear here. Right. But here the projection is scattered. Okay. So let us see, you know, basically the idea is. I just want to reinforce the point. Okay. So you're trying to compute ultimately what. The sum of the square of errors and then minimize it. So that is the idea. So if you want to build a model. So you are trying to minimize the sum of the squares. Okay. So in this particular case. So when it is a. When there are two explanatory variables. So naturally the model will be plain. Okay. So now how many planes are possible? So in case B. You know, so there are multiple planes which can. So you can see the minimum sum of squares. But in case a it is only one. Okay. So that is the idea which they are trying to drive in. The impact of co linearity on the stability of least squares regression plane. In a, the correlation between X1 and X2 is small. So that's why we can see that the points are of the projection. You know, it's all scattered. The regression plane therefore has a broad base of support. So it's you know, that's why the regression plane is more stable. But here it's only just on a linear, you know, it's only on a one particular line. So that is why they're saying that it is less stable. And then more planes are possible. In B, X1 and X2 are perfectly correlated. The least square plane is not uniquely defined. So there can be multiple planes passing through the line. So this is quite straight forward. In C, it is not perfect. Colinearity doesn't exist. But it's near to that. So linear relation less than perfect linear relationship between X1 and X2. The least square plane is still uniquely defined, but it is not well supported by the data. So for the same three categories or these three cases. So they computed RSS. What is RSS anybody? The residual sum of the regression So our idea is to minimize the, you know, even residual sum of squares also. So, now please take a look at the A and B. And tell like what is the problem with B. The advantage of A or B. I think there are two minimum points in the B and in a there is only one. B how many minimum points are there? I think two. Why so. And what are they? So that are the corners. Well, it is not like there are two points definitely, but the thing is like along. You know those two points the line connecting along those two points. So all have that minimum value of RSS. Yeah, so basically the diagonal that is joining the base. So all the points existing on that have the minimum RSS. You know, the B vector if you want to find so there are like multiple B vectors. So then that is a bit challenge, but here in the first first case, you know, so there is only, you know, one minimum.

548,Can you explain this slide?,This slide explains regularization techniques to handle collinearity by either redefining variables or using variable selection methods.,7,4,"So how are we going to handle this particular collinearity. Now we said that, okay, there can be some explanatory variables, which are linearly related. Like we saw X1 and X2 if they are linearly related. So they say that why don't you come up with a new variable instead of X1 and X2. Say consider X prime. And then define a new variable, which is having a proper relationship like this, you know, the standard deviation. And then X1 by standard deviation of X1, X2 by standard deviation of X2. So these are like various ways, you know. This is called as model re specification. And then there is another way that. Suppose a particular variable. Like I say that, okay, the rent of a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan is dependent on the government's policy. So the government's policies, like US government federal policies. Those who are in Manhattan. Those who want to rent one bedroom unit, I will give them five dollars. So will that have any effect on them.? Our prediction if we add that as a variable? It will not have an effect. But if if the government says we are going to fund, you know, 50% of their rent or 25% of say realistically 10% of their rent. So immediately it will have effect. It will have an effect like if we bring that particular criteria into our model. So it will have an effect. So the understanding is like, when we are building a model, each explanatory variable has some effect on the response variable in itself. So here we are trying to, you know, eliminate. So there is a forward. There's a backward. There are ways of considering these variables. How many variables to include in our model. 10, 100,1000 how many explanatory variables to include. So they are saying a forward model. Let us start one by one. Okay. The rent depends on location. So that is the first thing. And then after that. The rent depends on the neighborhood. I mean location means. Yeah, it's a business center and then all those things. And then second thing is the crime rate. You know, so like that one of the variables we add. And then see that how much it is having the effect on the final. This is called the forward process. So variable selection is one of the methods of addressing the collinearity. A common but unusually misguided approach to collinearity is variable selection, where some automatic procedure is employed to reduce the regressors or the explainer variables in the model. So I was discussing the forward selection. We are considering the explanatory variables. Forward selection methods add explanatory variables to the model one at a time. At each step, the variable yields the largest increment in r square. Okay. So the delta of the r square, so whichever is the variable that is adding to giving the largest increment. So that we are going to add. So this is one of the method. So the process just stops for example when the increment is smaller than the person. Preset criteria. And the backward similarly there is a backward elimination like let us consider 1000 explanatory variables. Let us consider all the 1000 and then start eliminating one after another. So which is like less influential. You are going to build the model. So how much the model should be responsive. So there is no standard definition. They say heuristic means you know you observe and then you choose a delta. Thresholds are always heuristic. The forward is like you're adding one after one variable. When you're going to add a particular variable to your model on what basis? So first you will see the highest variable that is going to contribute. So to the R square. So that will be.

So, the purpose of these two is whenever the dataset is too huge or explanatory variables are too many, we will use ridge regression and if there are less explanatory variables, then we will use lasso regression. So, what is lasso regression? So this is a regularization technique used in feature selection. We are trying to get the B vector. There are some explanatory variables which are not useful. So we are trying to eliminate those explanatory variables. Like, you know, the government of US is giving some support, but it is not useful, you know, we're going to eliminate that. So just for an example. So idea is to find what are the most influential explanatory variables, which we have to retain in our model. So this is a regularization technique used in feature selection. Using a shrinkage method also referred to as penalized regression method. So you are adding a penalty term. Okay. Lasso is the short form of this: Least absolute shrinkage selection operator, which is used both for regularization and model selection. If a model uses L1 regularization technique, then it is called Lasso regression. So in this shrinkage technique, coefficients are determined in a linear model, above or shrunk towards the central point as the mean by introducing a penalization factor. The penalty term that denotes the amount of shrinkage that will be implemented in the equation. So, and when this is 0, so then you will get the the standard thing. The model from equation 1.2 and a larger value penalizes the optimization function. Therefore, lesser regression shrinks the coefficients and helps to reduce the model complexity. So, let us see what is the ridge regression. So, ridge regression you see here they are considering this beta square, sum of the squares. The penalty factor basically contains the sum of the squares. Similar to lasso regression, ridge regression puts a similar constraint on the coefficients by introducing a penalty factor. Okay. However, while lasso regression takes the magnitude of the coefficients, ridge regression takes the square. Lasso tends to do well if there are small number of significant parameters, significant parameters means those explanatory variables that have an impact on the response to give them. Okay, and the others are close to 0. So, ridge works well if there are many large parameters of about the same value. So, the baseline is we don't know the parameters unless we try in the model. Or in practice, we don't know the true parameter values. So, the previous two points are somewhat theoretical. Okay. So, there is something called as cross validation.",closed_qa

We can compute the mean rental price from these values. However, when we talk about the distribution of the mean, what does that actually mean? Suppose we compute the mean from this set of 10 values—since there is only one dataset, this mean is a single fixed number. But if we say there is a distribution of the mean, it implies that we are generating multiple means by repeatedly drawing different sets of samples. To understand this, imagine that instead of computing a single mean from one dataset, we create multiple new datasets by resampling from the original set. For instance, we generate Set 1, Set 2, Set 3, … Set n by resampling with replacement. Each time, we compute the mean for that new dataset. This process allows us to build a distribution of sample means. This is a key idea behind bootstrapping, where we generate new datasets from an existing dataset to understand the variability of statistical estimates. we observe that the histogram of sample means approximates a normal distribution, even if the original dataset was not normally distributed.

From this, we calculate the mean of bootstrap means (μ̄) and standard deviation (std(μ)), which serves as an estimate of the standard error. This method provides an empirical way to approximate the sampling distribution of a statistic without needing a large dataset or theoretical formulas. In the next slide, we’ll explore its applications further.",open_qa

881,What is the purpose of using the bootstrap method?,"To compute standard errors, or even full distributions of complex or nonlinear summary statistics.",15,5,"Now, let’s explore some practical applications of bootstrapping in machine learning and statistical modeling. Bootstrapping is useful when we need to estimate the standard error (SE) or obtain full distributions of complex or nonlinear summary statistics. This includes measures such as standard deviation, median, or the 79th percentile. Additionally, bootstrapping can be applied in custom statistical computations, such as functions written in Python, which may involve extensive data processing and business logic.
For example, we can use bootstrapping in:
Regression models, where we resample the dataset multiple times and compute a vector B.
Hyperparameter tuning, where we run a subset selection algorithm using cross-validation, perform a final fit, and return the estimated  B vector.
Deep learning, where we train a deep neural network multiple times on bootstrap samples and observe the variations in the learned weight vectors.
Prediction models, where we build multiple models, each trained on different bootstrap samples, allowing for robust performance estimation.
However, bootstrapping is not without its challenges. One major issue is the presence of outliers. For instance, imagine a scenario where 10 people have an average income of $100, but one individual earns $1000. This high-income individual is an outlier and can significantly distort the bootstrap-based estimates. The question arises: How do outliers impact bootstrapping methods? This is an open-ended issue that needs careful consideration. Another challenge is the dependency among data points. Unlike independent observations (e.g., measuring rental prices of one-bedroom apartments), bootstrapping creates resampled datasets where values are often repeated, leading to potential bias in estimation. This dependency can make bootstrapping less robust for certain applications.",summarization

Bootstrapping is useful when we need to estimate the standard error (SE) or obtain full distributions of complex or nonlinear summary statistics. This includes measures such as standard deviation, median, or the 79th percentile. Additionally, bootstrapping can be applied in custom statistical computations, such as functions written in Python, which may involve extensive data processing and business logic.
For example, we can use bootstrapping in:
Regression models, where we resample the dataset multiple times and compute a vector B.
Hyperparameter tuning, where we run a subset selection algorithm using cross-validation, perform a final fit, and return the estimated  B vector.
Deep learning, where we train a deep neural network multiple times on bootstrap samples and observe the variations in the learned weight vectors.
Prediction models, where we build multiple models, each trained on different bootstrap samples, allowing for robust performance estimation.
However, bootstrapping is not without its challenges. One major issue is the presence of outliers. For instance, imagine a scenario where 10 people have an average income of $100, but one individual earns $1000. This high-income individual is an outlier and can significantly distort the bootstrap-based estimates. The question arises: How do outliers impact bootstrapping methods? This is an open-ended issue that needs careful consideration. Another challenge is the dependency among data points. Unlike independent observations (e.g., measuring rental prices of one-bedroom apartments), bootstrapping creates resampled datasets where values are often repeated, leading to potential bias in estimation. This dependency can make bootstrapping less robust for certain applications.",closed_qa

1057,Can you explain this slide?,This slide explains regularization in logistic regression to address multicollinearity and separability issues. It introduces L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to prevent coefficients from growing infinitely large and improve model stability.,18,6,"In logistic regression, we often encounter two major issues—multicollinearity and separability. Multicollinearity arises when predictor variables are highly correlated, leading to instability in coefficient estimates. This can result in a ridge in the likelihood surface, meaning small variations in the data can cause large fluctuations in coefficient values. On the other hand, separability happens when the classification problem is too easy, meaning the classes are perfectly separable. In such cases, the estimated coefficients tend to grow infinitely large, as depicted in the figure with B=∞. This leads to overfitting, where the model works well on training data but generalizes poorly to unseen data. To address these issues, we use regularization, which introduces a penalty term to the likelihood function, preventing coefficients from becoming excessively large. There are two common types of regularization. L2 regularization (Ridge Regression) adds a penalty proportional to the sum of squared coefficients: lnL−λi∑​Bi2​ This discourages large coefficient values but does not shrink them to zero. L1 regularization (Lasso Regression), on the other hand, adds a penalty proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients: lnL−λi∑​∣Bi​∣ L1 regularization not only prevents overfitting but also performs feature selection by forcing some coefficients to become exactly zero, effectively removing less important variables from the model. regularization helps maintain model stability and generalization by controlling the complexity of the model.

This table summarizes key differences between the two models, focusing on their likelihood distribution, loss function, link function, prediction method, goodness of fit, model comparison metrics, and confidence intervals. First, let's start with the likelihood distribution. In linear regression, we assume the dependent variable yi​ follows a normal distribution with a mean of BXi​ and variance σϵ2​. This assumption allows us to model continuous outcomes. In contrast, logistic regression assumes a Bernoulli distribution, meaning each outcome follows a binary probability model, where pi​ represents the probability that the outcome is 1. Next, the loss function differs between the two models. In linear regression, we minimize the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), which is simply the squared differences between actual and predicted values. However, in logistic regression, we maximize the log-likelihood function instead. The log-likelihood is a function of the predicted probabilities πi​, ensuring that the model captures the probability distribution of the binary outcome.Moving to the link function, linear regression uses an identity link function, meaning the relationship between input features and output is linear. However, logistic regression applies the logit function, which transforms the linear combination of inputs into a probability between 0 and 1. For prediction, linear regression estimates y^​ directly as BX, while in logistic regression, we use the sigmoid function to transform BX into a probability π\piπ, which determines the classification output. Now, looking at goodness of fit, we see that both models use an adjusted R^2 metric, but in different ways. Linear regression calculates R^2 based on the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) and Total Sum of Squares (TSS), while logistic regression computes R^2 using the ratio of log-likelihoods from the full and constant-only models. When comparing models, linear regression uses the F-statistic, which assesses how much the regression sum of squares improves the fit compared to the residual sum of squares. On the other hand, logistic regression uses deviance (G^2_0​), which is derived from the log-likelihood difference between the full model and the null (constant-only) model. Lastly, for confidence intervals, both models rely on the standard normal distribution, where the coefficient estimate BBB is divided by its standard error SE(B) to follow a normal distribution.",summarization

However, when building a model, we have not yet considered the types of explanatory variables being modeled. So far, we have simply assumed that if an explanatory variable exists, we can apply linear regression. But what if these explanatory variables possess different properties? suppose we want to model the number of people visiting a zoo within specific time intervals—from 10 AM to 11 AM, 11 AM to 12 PM, and so on. Here, we are dealing with count data, which is inherently discrete. Now, contrast this with another scenario: modeling the height of a person relative to their age. In this case, age is a continuous variable, which behaves differently from count data. Real-world data often exhibits different inherent classifications or labels, and these variations require us to choose appropriate probability distributions for effective modeling. In today’s discussion, we will explore how to select different distributions based on the nature of the data and how Generalized Linear Models help in handling diverse data types effectively.

1097,"Can you explain this slide?
","This slide introduces logistic regression as part of generalized linear models (GLMs). It explains the logit function, which is defined as log(P / (1 - P)), where P is the probability of an event occurring. It also introduces the Bernoulli distribution for binary outcomes, the concept of linear predictors (β values), and the link function, which connects the explanatory variables to the response variable.",2,8,"This is the logit function. If you recall from our previous discussion, we covered prohibit and logit models. Can anyone recall the formula for the logit function? The logit of P is given by: \logit(P)=log(P / 1−P)
Here, P represents the probability of an event occurring. What does P / (1 - P) signify? It represents the odds of an event occurring. For example, if the probability of winning a match is 0.4, then the odds against winning are 0.4 / 0.6. The logit function, therefore, transforms the probability into a log-odds scale, making it useful for logistic regression. In this case, πᵢ represents the probability of occurrence for Yᵢ, which is our response variable. Yᵢ follows a Bernoulli distribution, which means there are only two possible outcomes. The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution, but it applies to a single trial. For example, flipping a coin results in either heads or tails. Similarly, if a participant enters a competition, they will either win or lose (although in some cases, a draw might also be possible). If there are multiple independent trials, we move from a Bernoulli distribution to a binomial distribution. For example, if you're answering a True or False question, the response follows a Bernoulli distribution. However, if you're taking a quiz with 10 True/False questions, the responses across all questions together follow a binomial distribution. Now, when working with Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), three key components define the model:
Response Variable (Y) – The dependent variable we aim to model.
Linear Predictors (Regressors) – A set of β coefficients such as β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., which are used to build the model. The model is called ""linear"" not because the response variable is necessarily linear, but because the regressors (β values) appear in a linear form (i.e., they are not exponential or logarithmic).
Link Function – This function establishes the relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variables.
For instance, in a simple linear regression, we express Y as: 
Y=β0 +β1X1 +β2X2 +...+βnXn
​In this case, the expected value E(Y) acts as the link function. However, there are other link functions that allow us to model different types of data.
Now, let's discuss the basic structure of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) before diving into specific types. The logistic regression model is just one example of a broader category of GLMs.

GLMs consist of three primary components:
Random Component – Represents the probability distribution of the response variable Y. For example, in binary logistic regression, Y follows a binomial distribution.
Systematic Component – Refers to the explanatory variables (X₁, X₂, ...) combined in a linear predictor form. This explains why GLMs are called linear models—because the regressors are linear.
Link Function (g(μ)) – Defines how the expected value of Y is related to the linear predictors. It links the random component (Y) with the systematic component (explanatory variables X₁, X₂, ...).
For example, let's compare two types of regression: Simple Linear Regression: Models how the mean (expected value) of a continuous response variable (Y) depends on explanatory variables (X). Random Component: Y follows a normal distribution.
Systematic Component: X variables are explanatory variables with linear parameters β₀, β₁, ....
Link Function: Identity function (g(μ) = μ).
Binary Logistic Regression: Models how a binary response variable (0/1 outcome) depends on explanatory variables (X).
Random Component: Y follows a binomial distribution.
Systematic Component: X variables are linear predictors.
Link Function: Logit function (logit(π) = log(P / 1 - P)).
Thus, in linear regression, the link function is an identity function, while in logistic regression, the link function is a logit function. The choice of a link function depends on the nature of the response variable and how we want to transform it to establish a meaningful relationship with explanatory variables.
This understanding helps in choosing the right type of GLM based on the data and ensures that the response variable is appropriately modeled with respect to the predictors.

In logistic regression, the logit function is the link function, mapping probabilities to a linear scale. In linear regression, the identity function acts as the link function.",2,8,"This is the logit function. If you recall from our previous discussion, we covered prohibit and logit models. Can anyone recall the formula for the logit function? The logit of P is given by: \logit(P)=log(P / 1−P)
Here, P represents the probability of an event occurring. What does P / (1 - P) signify? It represents the odds of an event occurring. For example, if the probability of winning a match is 0.4, then the odds against winning are 0.4 / 0.6. The logit function, therefore, transforms the probability into a log-odds scale, making it useful for logistic regression. In this case, πᵢ represents the probability of occurrence for Yᵢ, which is our response variable. Yᵢ follows a Bernoulli distribution, which means there are only two possible outcomes. The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution, but it applies to a single trial. For example, flipping a coin results in either heads or tails. Similarly, if a participant enters a competition, they will either win or lose (although in some cases, a draw might also be possible). If there are multiple independent trials, we move from a Bernoulli distribution to a binomial distribution. For example, if you're answering a True or False question, the response follows a Bernoulli distribution. However, if you're taking a quiz with 10 True/False questions, the responses across all questions together follow a binomial distribution. Now, when working with Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), three key components define the model:
Response Variable (Y) – The dependent variable we aim to model.
Linear Predictors (Regressors) – A set of β coefficients such as β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., which are used to build the model. The model is called ""linear"" not because the response variable is necessarily linear, but because the regressors (β values) appear in a linear form (i.e., they are not exponential or logarithmic).
Link Function – This function establishes the relationship between the response variable and the explanatory variables.
For instance, in a simple linear regression, we express Y as: 
Y=β0 +β1X1 +β2X2 +...+βnXn
​In this case, the expected value E(Y) acts as the link function. However, there are other link functions that allow us to model different types of data.
Now, let's discuss the basic structure of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) before diving into specific types. The logistic regression model is just one example of a broader category of GLMs.

GLMs consist of three primary components:
Random Component – Represents the probability distribution of the response variable Y. For example, in binary logistic regression, Y follows a binomial distribution.
Systematic Component – Refers to the explanatory variables (X₁, X₂, ...) combined in a linear predictor form. This explains why GLMs are called linear models—because the regressors are linear.
Link Function (g(μ)) – Defines how the expected value of Y is related to the linear predictors. It links the random component (Y) with the systematic component (explanatory variables X₁, X₂, ...).
For example, let's compare two types of regression: Simple Linear Regression: Models how the mean (expected value) of a continuous response variable (Y) depends on explanatory variables (X). Random Component: Y follows a normal distribution.
Systematic Component: X variables are explanatory variables with linear parameters β₀, β₁, ....
Link Function: Identity function (g(μ) = μ).
Binary Logistic Regression: Models how a binary response variable (0/1 outcome) depends on explanatory variables (X).
Random Component: Y follows a binomial distribution.
Systematic Component: X variables are linear predictors.
Link Function: Logit function (logit(π) = log(P / 1 - P)).
Thus, in linear regression, the link function is an identity function, while in logistic regression, the link function is a logit function. The choice of a link function depends on the nature of the response variable and how we want to transform it to establish a meaningful relationship with explanatory variables.
This understanding helps in choosing the right type of GLM based on the data and ensures that the response variable is appropriately modeled with respect to the predictors.

This process follows a binomial distribution. Similarly, a financial transaction can be either fraudulent or genuine. If a person retweets a post or not, it is also a binary outcome. In these scenarios, where there are only two possible outcomes, we refer to them as dichotomous variables, which follow a binomial distribution.",open_qa

L2 penalty (Ridge Regression): Adds the squared magnitude of the model coefficients as a penalty term. This prevents large coefficient values but does not eliminate features like Lasso.
The key difference between L1 and L2 is that L1 leads to sparsity (feature selection), while L2 prevents large weights but retains all features. Generally, L2 is used for large datasets, while L1 is preferred when feature selection is necessary.
